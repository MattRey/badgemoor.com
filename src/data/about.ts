    text: "Badgemoor was founded by James Vlasto in 2009. James has extensive experience of all aspects of the residential property industry working at director level within the fields of Estate Agency and Development & Investment since 2001. He gained a reputation for giving measured, honest advice and the company stemmed from an increasing private demand for his consultancy. Expanding entirely through referral, Badgemoor clients now span 6 continents (we're looking into Antarctica!). A keen sportsman, James plays hockey and squash whenever he can and is possibly happiest when on the water with his family.",

He thrived at both Foxtons and Hamptons International across Central and West London before establishing and running the in-house lettings and management agency Battersea Power Station, one of the largest redevelopment projects in Europe. This experience has given Mark a rounded view of the city and its regional nuances. Respected due to his honest, personable and considered approach, Mark is an asset to the Badgemoor team and is well placed to guide our clients through the forthcoming changes to the sector. A previous career as a sommelier and wine buyer afforded Mark the opportunity to travel to various beautiful destinations around the globe, something he is still passionate about, alongside improving his tennis game.",
