    text: "I cannot recommend working with James Vlasto highly enough. The process of looking for a house from half way across the world was made hugely efficient, in the sense that James quickly understood our brief, only showed us houses on that brief and most importantly, sourced outstanding houses yet to go on the market. He also helped me negotiated a very good deal with the seller. In life you tend to get what you pay for. In James case, you get more.",

    text: "James negotiated the purchase of a new flat opposite my existing one at a much lower price than the asking price. Once that was complete he went beyond the brief and helped my buy corridor space so I could connect the two flats. Somehow he managed the multiple agents involved with total ease. I will use him again in the future without doubt.",

    text: "Living overseas, the complexities of finding and purchasing a property in London seemed overwhelming but Badgemoor took all the stress and headache out of the process from start to finish.  Right from finding the right property for us, negotiating the sale, sprucing the place up, managing the letting agent and now the tenants, they have been invaluable - and all this in a very short timeframe.  Thank you to James and the team for making what could have been a very painful process, seamless and stress free.",

    text: "I knew of James before we even worked together. His reputation of being the best in his industry preceded him. The words Intent and Great Resolve come to mind. Having now worked with James I can see why. Not only is James extremely professional and knowledgeable at what he does but he always has his clients best interests at heart with the most tactful air of discretion I know. James could always be trusted to work with you and achieve all goals set, even with a five hour time difference. His personable nature makes him a complete pleasure to work with and I would highly recommend him to any future clients.",

    text: "Buying a property with James really has been a wonderful experience; I couldn't have done it without him. It's been invaluable to have someone with such knowledge and expertise, making buying a property not just stress free, but actually enjoyable. James, you've been a pleasure to work with and I really will miss scooting around London with you! ",

    text: "James assisted us in the search of a family flat. We spoke to many property searchers and selected James because he immediately understood our wishes, he had a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the London property market and the necessary contacts with real estate agents which allowed us to view flats before they came to the market. James followed the brief but on top he was able to step into our shoes and anticipate wishes we had not yet even thought of. Having James searching for us is as if we would do it ourselves but better. We appreciated a lot his responsiveness, flexibility, hard work and integrity in his business dealings. We were able to secure and close our purchase under time pressure thanks to James' legal and expert contacts and close follow up. He also gave us contacts of builders for the refurbishment works. We want to thank James not only for having done a great job but also for his sense of humour and can-do mentality.",

    text: "James is extremely knowledgeable about the London property market. His customized and personalized service has made a real difference in helping us with our property investment and management, which can be a real pain especially as an overseas investor. I like the fact that he deals with a limited number of clients at a given time, which gives him the ability to focus on his client's needs and he has his client's interest at heart, He has a small but efficient team which can assist in handling different aspects of your property so the one stop shop service is highly efficient. I would highly recommend him to anyone who is interested in considering property investments in London",

    text: "James came highly recommended to us and we can only echo all the good things we were told. He helped us as international clients to find and purchase a London property and then effortlessly oversaw the renovations. Always listening to our needs, responding without ever having to chase him, James came up with the goods on every aspect of the project. Costs were as the initial quote, total transparency throughout - no hidden extras or surprises.  We now have our new London home and couldn’t be happier. Only one small regret … we wish we’d called him sooner!",

    text: "We were referred to James by a mutual friend — and for good reason. Although we thought we had a good understanding of the London property market, James’s expertise was on an entirely different level. He worked with a very specific brief and delivered exactly what we were looking for. His knowledge of pricing, light aspects, potential planning permissions, and the overall feel of different neighbourhoods is exceptional. With James, you truly feel like you’re in safe, capable hands. Thank you, James!",
